# BSON to JSON mass-converter
A simple tool to convert multiple BSON documents into humnan-readable JSON files.

## But why?
Because I don't want to constantly download the MongoDB database tools and run mongorestore. And also I didn't see any similar tool out there.

All contributions are welcome, the tool is released under GPL-3.0!
